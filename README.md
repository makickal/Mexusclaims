I can only dream of this country someday legislating similar laws. You are right on, # 9 is a winner.

There will be no special bilingual programs in the schools.
All ballots will be in this nation’s language.

All government business will be conducted in our language.

Non-residents will NOT have the right to vote no matter how long they are here.

Non-citizens will NEVER be able to hold political office.

Foreigners will not be a burden to the taxpayers. No welfare, no food stamps, no healthcare, or other government assistance programs. Any burden will be deported.

Foreigners can invest in this country, but it must be an amount at least equal to 40,000 times the daily minimum wage.

If foreigners come here and buy land… options will be restricted. Certain parcels including waterfront property are reserved for citizens naturally born into this country.

Foreigners may have no protests; no demonstrations, no waving of a foreign flag, no political organizing, no bad-mouthing our president or his policies. These will lead to deportation.

If you do come to this country illegally, you will be actively hunted and, when caught, sent to jail until your deportation can be arranged. All assets will be taken from you.

 Too strict? The above laws are the current immigration laws of MEXICO!
